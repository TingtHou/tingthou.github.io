I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Experimental Statistics at Louisiana State University.

My research primarily focuses on statistical genetics and statistical/machine learning. One area of my research involves developing statistical and machine learning methods for high-dimensional data analysis, such as genetic data analysis. In parallel with this, I am also interested in developing deep learning and statistical methods, as well as software, for analyzing large-scale multi-omics data, including but not limited to genetics, single-cell genomics, and metagenomics. In addition to creating new methods, I collaborate with other researchers to explore various biomedical and public health research questions.
