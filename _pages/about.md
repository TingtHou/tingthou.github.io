I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Experimental Statistics at Louisiana State University.

My research primarily focuses on statistical genetics and statistical/machine learning. A key aspect of my work involves developing statistical and machine learning methods for high-dimensional data analysis, particularly in genetic data. Additionally, I am interested in creating deep learning and statistical methods, along with software, for analyzing large-scale and high-dimensional datasets. This includes genome-wide association studies and functional genomic sequencing studies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatially resolved transcriptomics. By developing novel analytic methods, I aim to extract critical insights from these data and enhance our understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypic variation in various human diseases and disease-related quantitative traits.
